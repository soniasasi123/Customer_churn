# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major problem in subscription-based businesses. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on their demographics, account information, and service usage.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Gender
- Senior Citizen
- Tenure
- Monthly Charges
- Total Charges
- Contract Type
- Payment Method
- Churn (Target Variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Encoding & Scaling
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Prediction

## 📈 Results
The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with high accuracy and recall for churn customers.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment using Flask or Streamlit
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
